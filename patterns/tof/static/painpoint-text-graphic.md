# TOF × Static × Pain Point — Text Graphic Pattern

## Use when
The problem is instantly recognizable and you can say it in 7–12 words.

## Hook formulas
- “Still dealing with {X} after {Y}?”
- “If you’re {persona}, stop doing {bad thing}.”
- “Your competitors solved {X} 6 months ago.”

## Layout
- Top: Hook (big)
- Middle: 1-line consequence
- Bottom: 1 proof cue or “fix”
- CTA microtext: “See how →”

- screenshot blur (tease)

## Don’ts
